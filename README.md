# Haskell-inspired list variations in C++ (for MCCS talk)

I prepared these examples for a talk I delivered to the Marist College
Computer Society in 2015. I had fun just playing around with all sorts
of variations to better understand the performance implications of
certain design and implementation choices. Still a work in progress!
